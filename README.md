# PyBer_Analysis module 5 challenge
## Overview: 
#### The purpose of this challenge is using python and panads to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type, as well as using the matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph, in order to shows the total weekly fares for each city type. to sum up, the mainly purpose is to virtualize the dataframe, so that the data will be easily to be read, and help us to know the tendency in order to get better idea and help us to make a decision.

## Results:
#### Going through this project, Urban has the most amount of total riders, total drivers and total fare, Suburban is the 2nd most, and Rural has the least amount of it. but the Rural are seeing to have the highest average of fare for per ride and per driver, and Urban, however, has the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

#### and during the data from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-28, the line chart listing below, and Rural for blue, suburban for red and Urban for yellow. again, we get the result of urban is the highest amount and the Suburban is the lowest amount.

## Summary:
#### In this case we are able to see that the different type city's fare are disparity，there's savory reason we can tell what kind of diversity between city and city, but in our dataset，as data deficiencies, we don’t know what reason cause this result but there is also something that we still can say base on the type of the city.

#### First,Because a Rural area will have fewer workers, long travel time and longer distance, those will cause the average fare per ride and driver higher than all city types. 
#### Second, In the Urban city, even they have most amount of riders and drivers, their average fare per ride and per driver are still the lower one, as the traffic more common, hard to find parking spot to pick up and drop off and also sorter distance.
 
## recommendations:
#### Because urban cities have more driver and lower average fare per ride, the first things we can do is to get charge when driver's waiting for a rider, red light and stock in a traffic in order to balance the average fare per ride
#### set a booster or bonus to give the driver from urban city to work in rural city, to increase total driver amount and decrease total drivers in urban city, in order to balance average fare per driver.
#### increase the base fare for every ride, decrease the fare for distance. in order to increase the sort distance in the urban city's average fare per ride.
